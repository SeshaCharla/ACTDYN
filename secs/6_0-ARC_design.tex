In this section, a discontinuous projection based direct adaptive robust control
is implemented. Though the parameter convergence and tracking performance is
slightly lower than the  more advanced designs such as IARC and DIARC, DARC has
the advantage of being least computationally complex among them, resulting in
faster sampling times in resource limited scenarios.
